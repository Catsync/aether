##Purpose
**aether** aims to make it easy for people to learn and write CoffeeScript and JavaScript by helping them catch and fix bugs, 
letting them see and more easily understand the execution of their program [(like Brett Victor commanded!)](http://youtu.be/PUv66718DII?t=17m25s), 
and giving them tips on how they can improve their code. [CodeCombat](http://codecombat.com/) is behind it.

##Functionality

###Compilation
The program should determine whether a given piece of code compiles.
####Successful Compilation
If compilation is successful, aether will compare the generated AST to the last AST generated by the user to avoid unnecessary computation.

####Unsuccessful Compilation
#####Syntax Errors
aether should return a list of syntax errors and warnings coupled with the line and column information.
#####Additional Errors and Error Modification
aether should allow custom errors and modification of errors generated by the parser.

For example, spell checking could be ran at compile time (and configured at runtime), and detailed compile errors thrown.

By giving the user more detailed errors than those generated by the parser, a gentler educational experience can be provided.
#####Syntax manipulation
On certain errors, aether should manipulate the syntax to conform and throw a warning instead. For instance, if the user forgets a "this." while calling a method, it should be corrected, and the user educated about the mistake they made.

###Strict compilation
The code shall be compiled with the "use strict;" option to prevent the user from breaking the code with unsafe actions, such as accessing the global object, as well as catch some runtime errors before they happen.
